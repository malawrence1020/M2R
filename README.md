# M2R
## Welcome to our git repo!
This is the git repo for our M2R project on algorithmic differentiation. Here one can find all the code included in our report. This includes our forward-propagation algorithm (tangent-linear model), our backward-propagation algorithm (adjoint model) and Pytests to test the functionality of both.
## Test file to see if everyone can commit:
